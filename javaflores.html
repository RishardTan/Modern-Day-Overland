    <h2>Stage 1</h2>
    Only with limited information finally we decied  to send a vehicle via
    sea-transport to Maumere port located in the middle of Flores island,
    a 2-day trip on the sea from Surabaya finally arrived at Maumere, while
    our arrival 2 days later by air. Quite surprised because it turns out our
    vehicle has been taken from the port by the Pastor from Maumere Rubiah
    Pasiomis Church, reasons are safer than port, bit shocked but it is normal
    according to our coleauges on board during this kind of trip. We took a
    short break and have a friendly chat with the Sisters there offering for m
    eals and showers, immediately continue to Larantuka with approximately 3 hours
    drive. We will passing Mount Egon a stratovolcano the highest mountain in
    Flores, and we do stop for a ahort break by near Mount Lewotobi,
    male and female .... before entering the city of Larantuka, approximately 30K before.
    We arrived close to 8PM due to road construtions and some other issues.
