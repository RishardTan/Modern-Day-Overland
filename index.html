        <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallace_Line" class="architecture">Wallace Line</a></b>, boundary between the Oriental and Australian
        faunal regions, proposed by the 19th-century British naturalist
        Alfred Russel Wallace. The line extends from the Indian Ocean
        through the Lombok Strait (between the islands of Bali and Lombok),
        northward through the Makassar Strait (between Borneo and Celebes),
        and eastward, south of Mindanao, into the Philippine Sea. Although
        many zoogeographers no longer consider the Wallace Line to be a
        regional boundary, it does represent an abrupt limit of
        distribution for many major animal groups. Many fish, bird, and
        mammal groups are abundantly represented on one side of the Wallace
        Line but poorly or not at all on the other side.

        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architecture_of_Indonesia" class="architecture">Architecture of Indonesia</a> stretches from Sabang in the West to
        Merauke in the East which is also crossed by the Equator so
        climate, customs and traditions become very diverse which
        greatly influences the development process of vernacular
        architecture in Indonesia. Houses on the West side are different
        from the houses on the East where the humidity levels are also very
        diverse because geographically we are affected by the Australian
        climate, especially in Eastern part of Indonesia.

        In early 2013, the three of us wanted to take a short vacation
        to get out of our daily activities which are too monotonous.
        We are alumnis of a university in Bandung, majoring  in architecture.
        We have different business in different places, causing our
        enthusiasm to build up in arranging trips to destinations to each of  which
        we have never visited before by  bringing  our vehicles  that  are
        used in daily bases. Eastern Indonesia as our first trip destination  was
        agreed with fourteen-day corridor before returning back to each others routine.
        <br>
        <br>
        We chose the Eastern part of Indonesia because we have different
        flora and fauna with the island of Java where we live beside
        culture and traditional houses which are architecturally different
        because of the climate. With time and schedule constraints to plan together, this trip
        will only be carried out in August-September 2015.
        <br>
        <br>
        The basic concept of this trip is that we will use local lodging
        facilities at the place where we stop or stay during night times
        but there is always an option to stay for a camp when the scenery are very
        attractive and possible to make a camp stay during the overnight.
        Equipments required for these
        activities must be prepared from the beginning. In these trips we want
        to get to our daily destination before dark so we
        can enjoy the sunset and also the atmosphere around, we also set
        the travel time around 6-7 hours each day.
        <br>
        This site was meant to remember our journey and friendship.
